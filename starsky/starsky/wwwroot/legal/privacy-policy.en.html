    <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>

    <p>It is Starsky's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
      Policy
      applies to this domain (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
      Starsky). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you
      may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be
      collected
      on
      our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy
      Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
      sources.
    </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing
      your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and
      conditions.</p>

    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Like most website operators, Starsky collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers
      typically
      make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
      Starsky's
      purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Starsky's visitors use its website. From time
      to
      time, Starsky may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
      of
      its website.</p>
    <p>Starsky also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.
      Starsky only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
      addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Certain visitors to Starsky's websites choose to interact with Starsky in ways that require Starsky to gather personally-identifying
      information. We require an email address to login.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or
      method
      of
      electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we
      cannot
      guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
      recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your
      computer.
      This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest
      to
      you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Starsky and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Starsky discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
      contractors
      and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Starsky's behalf or to provide services
      available at Starsky's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
      affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Starsky's website, you consent to the transfer of such
      information to them. Starsky will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
      anyone.
      Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Starsky discloses potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental
      request,
      or when Starsky believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Starsky, third
      parties
      or the public at large.</p>

    <p>If you are a registered user of Starsky and have supplied your email address, Starsky may occasionally send
      you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Starsky and
      our
      products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If
      you
      send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
      to
      help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Starsky takes all measures reasonably necessary to
      protect
      against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
      information.</p>

    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
    <p>Starsky may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Starsky may display this information publicly or
      provide
      it
      to others. However, Starsky does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>


    <h2 id="cookie">Cookies</h2>
    <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Starsky uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display
      personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the
      website
      each time the visitor returns. Starsky uses cookies to help Starsky identify and track visitors, their usage of
      Starsky and their website access preferences. Starsky visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
      their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Starsky's websites, with the drawback that certain features
      of
      Starsky's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
    <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to Starsky's use of
      cookies.</p>


    <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
    <p>If Starsky, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Starsky goes out of business or enters
      bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
      transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Starsky may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Starsky may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Starsky's sole
      discretion.
      Starsky encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after
      any
      change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
