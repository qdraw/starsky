# Starsky Geo Core

## Feature GeoLookup

The goal of this feature is:
1. Apply GPX data to images
2. Reverse geo code images

When your camera has no GPS support build in you can use your mobile phone to keep your track. This core logic can be used in other applications to combine a list of your recent locations and when the photo has taken into a location. When you have a GPX track file and a photo you can know where it is taken. With various sport track apps support exporting gpx files.

The command line interface is available in `starskyGeoCli`
