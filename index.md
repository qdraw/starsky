# What is Starsky? (an introduction)

Starsky is a free photo-management tool, which runs on your server or web-space. Installing is a matter of running the application. It acts as an accelerator to find and organize images driven by meta information. Browse and search images in your own cloud. Starsky is the name of the Starsky DAM (Digital asset management) system that runs as a desktop application and web service.
You could add how to add users, set up your archives, upload content, control metadata, share content and more.

## Accelerator for self-hosted photo-management
Starsky helps you get more value from creative digital assets like images and videos by making them easy to organize, access and distribute. The focus of the application is an individual’s digital file library or a photographer’s photo database.  The goal is to have a application that store, organize, find, retrieve and share digital content.

## Indexing and finding stuff back
A primary function of a DAM system is to make assets easily available to its users by providing a searchable index that supports retrieval of assets by their content and/or metadata. The cataloging function is usually part of the ingestion process for new assets.

## Creation
Applications implement digital asset management by importing media types

## Access control
The application includes security controls ensuring relevant people have access to assets.

## Workflow
Export smaller images and generation of templates is one of the features

## Prepare for publication and add a watermark
Before I publish an item on my blog or social media, I do an automatic publication action. This places a watermark in the images. By means of configuration it is also possible that html is generated with meta information also attached so that search engines can find this content faster.
