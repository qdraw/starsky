## Mock API

The mock API in starsky-tools is designed to simulate the behavior of the real Starsky backend services. It allows developers to develop and test the front-end and integration flows without needing a live backend. This is especially useful for local development, automated tests, and CI environments.

The mock API provides endpoints that mimic the structure and responses of the actual APIs used in Starsky. This includes endpoints for file management, metadata, search, and user authentication. By using the mock API, you can ensure your client application handles various scenarios and edge cases in a controlled environment.
