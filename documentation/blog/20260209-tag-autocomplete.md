# Tag Autocomplete

Tagging your photos is one of the best ways to keep your collection organized and searchable. But as your library grows, it can become difficult to remember which tags you’ve used or to keep your tags consistent. That’s where the new **Tag Autocomplete** feature in Starsky comes in. This feature is avaiable in v0.7.11 or later

## What is Tag Autocomplete?

Tag Autocomplete makes it easier and faster to add tags (keywords) to your images. As you start typing a tag, Starsky will automatically suggest existing tags based on your previous entries. This helps you maintain consistency in your tagging, avoid typos, and quickly reuse tags you have used before.

## How does it work?

- When editing tags, a dropdown appears with suggestions as you type.
- Suggestions are based on tags already present in your photo collection.
- You can select a suggested tag or continue typing to add a new one.

## Why is this useful?

- **Speeds up the tagging process:** No need to type out full tags every time.
- **Reduces duplicate or misspelled tags:** Consistent tags mean better search results.
- **Helps organize your photo library more efficiently:** Find your images faster and keep your collection tidy.

## Perfect for large collections

Tag Autocomplete is especially useful for large collections where consistent tagging is important for search and organization. Whether you’re a professional photographer or just love taking pictures, this feature will help you keep your photo library in order with minimal effort.

Give Tag Autocomplete a try and see how much easier it is to manage your tags in Starsky!
