# Unit tests

In this project, we use unit tests to verify the correctness of individual components
in.

- Language: The unit tests are written in C#.
- Framework: The tests use a testing framework such as MSTest.
- Structure: The tests are organized to cover various layers and components of the application,
ensuring comprehensive coverage.
- Test Cases: Each test case is designed to validate specific functionality, edge cases, and error
conditions.
- Automation: The tests can be run automatically as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to
ensure that new changes do not introduce regressions.

## Here are some best practices for writing unit tests:

1. **Write Independent Tests**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the outcome of other
   tests.
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Test method names should clearly describe what is being tested and the
   expected outcome.
3. **Follow the AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert. First, set up the test data and environment (
   Arrange), then execute the code being tested (Act), and finally verify the result (Assert).
4. **Test One Thing at a Time**: Each test should focus on a single piece of functionality or
   behavior.
5. **Keep Tests Small and Focused**: Small, focused tests are easier to understand, maintain, and
   debug.
6. **Use Mocks and Stubs**: We manually mock services, at the moment we don't use a library for this.
7. **Ensure Tests are Repeatable**: Tests should produce the same results every time they are run,
   regardless of the environment or order of execution.
8. **Run Tests Frequently**: Integrate tests into the development process and run them frequently to
   catch issues early.
9. **Test Edge Cases and Error Conditions**: Ensure that tests cover edge cases and potential error
   conditions.
10. **Maintain Test Code Quality**: Apply the same standards to test code as you do to production
    code, including readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.

By following these best practices, you can create effective and reliable unit tests that help
maintain the quality of your codebase.
