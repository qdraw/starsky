# CodeQL

CodeQL is a powerful code analysis tool that allows developers to find security vulnerabilities 
and bugs in their codebase. It was originally developed by Semmle, 
a company acquired by GitHub in 2019, and it is now integrated into GitHub's security features. 
CodeQL uses a semantic code analysis approach to identify patterns and potential issues in code, 
using a custom query language to search for specific vulnerabilities and bugs. 
The platform is designed to work with a wide range of programming languages, 
including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and more. CodeQL allows developers 
to quickly find and fix vulnerabilities in their codebase, reducing the risk of security breaches 
and other issues. It is a powerful tool for any development team looking to improve the security 
and reliability of their software.

CodeQL should run on every push the main/master branch of the repository.
