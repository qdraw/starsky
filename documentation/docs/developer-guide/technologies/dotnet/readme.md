# .NET

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many kinds of applications. .NET is built on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale apps.

.NET apps (as written in a high-level language like C#) are compiled to an Intermediate Language (IL). 
IL is a compact code format that can be supported on any operating system or architecture.
Most .NET apps use APIs that are supported in multiple environments, requiring only the .NET runtime to run.

In this project the backend is written in C# using the .NET
