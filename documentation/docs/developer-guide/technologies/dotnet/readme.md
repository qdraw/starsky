# .NET

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many kinds of applications. .NET is built on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale apps.

.NET apps (as written in a high-level language like C#) are compiled to an Intermediate Language (IL). 
IL is a compact code format that can be supported on any operating system or architecture.
Most .NET apps use APIs that are supported in multiple environments, requiring only the .NET runtime to run.

A killer feature for a C# developer, because it helps you to start very quickly with all the tools you know.
On top of that, NUKE provides extensions for all major .NET IDE; Rider, 
Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code which let you run a target with its dependencies or without, 
start a debugging session directly from the target from the hit of a shortcut.
