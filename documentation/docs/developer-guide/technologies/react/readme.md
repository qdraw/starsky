# React

ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. 
It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application.

In this project we use ReactJS to build the user interface of the application.
The project is based on the Create React App with Typescript template.

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.
