# Cypress testing

Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It is designed to make it easy to write and 
run tests that simulate real user interactions with your application. 
Cypress runs directly in the browser and provides a simple and intuitive API for performing common testing tasks, 
such as navigating to a page, filling out forms, and clicking buttons. 
The framework provides an integrated test runner and debugger, making it easy to find and fix issues in your application. 
Cypress also offers advanced features like automatic waiting, network traffic control, and real-time reloading, 
which make it easier to test complex interactions and workflows. Additionally, 
Cypress provides a rich set of APIs for asserting and verifying the behavior of your application, 
making it a popular choice for modern web application testing.

Cypress is a front end testing tool built for the web. 
This project uses Cypress to test the user interface of the application.
