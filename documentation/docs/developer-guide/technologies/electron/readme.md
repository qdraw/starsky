# Electron (for desktop)

Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
By embedding Chromium and Node.js into its binary,
Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase
and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux â€”
no native development experience required.

Electron is maintained on GitHub and an active community of contributors.

## Project usage

In this project we use Electron to build the desktop application.
This desktop application is a wrapper around the web application.

## NodeJS

See [NodeJS](../nodejs/readme.md) for more details about the requirements
