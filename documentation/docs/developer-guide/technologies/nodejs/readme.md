# NodeJS

React and build script need NodeJS to run.
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 
It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. 
This allows Node.js to be very performant.
