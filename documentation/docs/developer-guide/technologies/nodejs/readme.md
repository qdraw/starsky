# NodeJS

React and build script need NodeJS to run.
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.
This allows Node.js to be very performant.

## NodeJS is only used for build tools and inside Electron

For running the application when its builded Node JS is not needed to be installed on the machine.
NodeJS is an dependency of [Electron](../electron/readme.md), but only used in the context of Electron. In our case Electron is only used with the Desktop app
