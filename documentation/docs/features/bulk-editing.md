# Bulk editing

Bulk editing is a feature that allows you to edit multiple files at once.
Is it possible to edit the metadata for multiple images at once.
You can use it in search and archive. In detail view you can edit the metadata for a single image.

When you selected an image you can update the metadata.
You can update the following metadata:

# Replace the metadata in the fields: tags, info or title

You can search and replace the metadata in the fields: tags, info or title.
Is easy to undo typos or update the metadata.

> Note: Tags are comma separated and unique.
> So when you add a tag that already exists, it will not be added.
