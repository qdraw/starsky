# Import 

With the import tool, you can now import from a camera or SD card (or anywhere on your computer) to the application library.
We've also added a new feature - autofill datetime based on EXIF data. EXIF data is the data that is stored in the image file.

Transferring the photos and videos from your camera to your photo library is not complicated, but often a manual task. 
			Yet this is easy to automate. You connect your SD card or USB cable and the computer does the rest of the process independently. 
			If your photo library has more structure, for example by organizing the photos by date, you can also configure this in the settings.

Import is by default done by the metadata field that contains the datetime the picture is made
If that field is not available, the file creation date is used.
When the meta data isn't available it will try to read the date from the filename.
