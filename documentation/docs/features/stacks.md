# Stacks

Stacks are enabled by default. Stacks are a way to group photos together. 
You may come across pictures that are associated with more than one media file.

## For what reasons can files be stacked?

- Files sharing exactly the same file and folder name will always be stacked together. 
  - for example `/2018/IMG_1234.jpg` and `/2018/IMG_1234.avi`
