# Stacks

Stacks are enabled by default. Stacks are a way to group photos together.

For example, you might have a photo that is associated with both a JPEG and an RAW file. 
In this case, the Stack organizes these two files together so that they are easier to find, manage and use later on.

You may come across pictures that are associated with more than one media file.

## For what reasons can files be stacked?

- Files sharing exactly the same file and folder name will always be stacked together. 
  - for example `/2018/IMG_1234.jpg` and `/2018/IMG_1234.avi`
