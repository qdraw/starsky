# What is Starsky? (an introduction)

Starsky is a free photo-management tool, which runs on your server or web-space. Installing is a matter of running the application. It acts as an accelerator to find and organize images driven by meta information. Browse and search images in your own cloud. Starsky is the name of the Starsky DAM (Digital asset management) system that runs as a desktop application and web service.
You could add how to add users, set up your archives, upload content, control metadata, share content and more.

## Accelerator for self-hosted photo-management

Starsky helps you get more value from creative digital assets like images and videos by making them easy to organize, access and distribute. The focus of the application is an individual’s digital file library or a photographer’s photo database. The goal is to have a application that store, organize, find, retrieve and share digital content.
