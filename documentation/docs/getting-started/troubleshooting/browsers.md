# Diagnosing Frontend Issues

Problems with the user interface can be caused by a bug or an incompatible browser:

- some features [may not be supported](https://caniuse.com/) by non-standard browsers, as well as nightly, unofficial, or outdated versions
- not all [video and audio formats](https://caniuse.com/?search=video%20format) can be played with every browser, device, and operating system
- for example, [AAC](https://caniuse.com/aac "Advanced Audio Coding") - the default audio codec for [MPEG-4 AVC / H.264](https://caniuse.com/avc "Advanced Video Coding") - is supported natively in Chrome, Safari, and Edge, while it is only optionally supported by the OS in Firefox and Opera

    If the user interface doesn't load at all, our [*App Not Loading*](index.md#app-not-loading) checklist helps you identify and resolve the cause.

## Try Another Browser ##

To test if you have a general problem that is not browser-specific, [open the Web UI](../docker-compose) in other browsers:

- if you are using [Firefox Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/), try the [stable version](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium)
- if you have browser plugins installed, try disabling them to see if this makes a difference
- when the problem disappears, you know that the issue is browser-dependent or caused by a plugin
- otherwise, the issue may not be specific to the browser version
- make a note in which browsers the problem occurs, as this will be helpful when submitting a support request

!!! tldr ""
    The user interface works with most modern browsers, and runs best on [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release), and [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).
    Opera and Samsung Internet have been reported to be compatible as well. Due to limited resources, we can
    not test every release with all browser types and versions.

## Getting Error Details ##

If possible, please also include the error type, error message, and URL of the affected resource when
submitting a support request. For this purpose, check the
browser console for warnings and errors as described below. It is perfectly fine to take screenshots
instead of writing down the details.

*In case you don't see any log messages, try reloading the page, as the problem may occur while the page is loading.*

    **We kindly ask you not to report bugs via *GitHub Issues* unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue that must be fixed directly in the app.**
    Ask for technical support if you need help, it could be a local
    configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works.
